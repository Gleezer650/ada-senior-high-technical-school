        <h2>Our Background</h2>
        <div class="about-content">
          <p>
            The Education Reform Programme of 1987 brought in its wake the establishment 
            of Senior Secondary Schools in the country to add to the existing ones. The 
            then Dangme East District Assembly embraced the concept and accepted the challenge.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sege, a rapidly developing town, some 76km from Accra and some 39km from Ada foah 
            on the main Accra-Afloa road, was selected. The argument at the time was that 
            Ada-Foah and Big Ada were already blessed with a Teacher Training College, Technical 
            Institute and a Secondary School.
          </p>
          <p>
            The history of Ada Senior High Technical School will not be complete without 
            mentioning names like Mr. Alex Tettey-Enyo (the then District Secretary of 
            Dangme East), the late Aaron Kicher, the late J.M.T Dosoo and Mr. Tetteh Akwadah.
          </p>
          <p>
            The new school which was christened Ada Secondary Technical School was officially 
            commissioned by Mr. Amos Buertey (M.P for Ada) on <b>February 22, 1991</b> with 
            110 students and 5 teachers.
